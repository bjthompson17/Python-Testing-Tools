# Python-Testing-Tools
The test_tools.py file features a few classes which make up a unique tool developed for testing python scripts. It includes automated testing for individual functions, user input, stdout and stderr stream comparison, and a timeout cutoff for infinite loops. Can also be used with PyTest and UnitTest Frameworks!
